[]  Figure out what each thing the full function returns is.
[]  Clean up repeated_k_fold

The algorithm runs all one and two parameter models, then at the end of each step only keeps the top step_number * {n_candidates} models to take into step 3, 
	then step_number * {n_candidates + number of features} from there on out

Split method: ks
Test ratio: 0.3

Parameters:
   13.7534 +
  -11.7574 * x142 vbur_near_vbur_min
   12.0219 * x182 sterimol_burB5_min
    7.4979 * x71 qpoletens_zz_boltz

Training R2  = 0.408
Training Q2  = 0.397
Training MAE = 11.764
Training K-fold R2 = 0.396 (+/- 0.000)

Test R2      = 0.331
Test MAE     = 15.764
