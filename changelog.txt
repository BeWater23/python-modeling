[]  forwardselect_q5.py doesn't seem to be used anywhere and I wan't to delete it.
[]  I want to merge loo_q2.py and kennardstonealgorithm.py into mlr_utils.py

Manual selection of features - removed built in method to try all add one parameter or remove one parameter models
Forward stepwise selection based on p-values was removed due to not having the required stepwise_selection2 module
other forward feature selection implementations - thrown out because it doesn't seem useful to me

[]  I need to combine loo_q2.py into mlr_utils.py and remove the need for the q2_par function.
[]  Figure out what each thing the full function returns is.

The algorithm runs all one and two parameter models, then at the end of each step only keeps the top step_number * {n_candidates} models to take into step 3, 
	then step_number * {n_candidates + number of features} from there on out

Split method: ks
